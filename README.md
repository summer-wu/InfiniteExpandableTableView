# InfiniteExpandableTableView
A Demo shows how to create a infinite expandable tableView.If you want to create a department hierachy list, a category list,this demo is for you!

**This is NOT a library.This is a skeleton!Don't be afraid to modify the code!**

I have searched all over the github,and cannot find a satisfied demo,so i create one.
##How to use 
There are 3 classes you need to change.

- JuneExpandableItem
- JuneExpandableCell
- InfiniteExpandableTableViewController.

June is the class prefix and has no other meaning.
